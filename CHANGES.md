## 0.11.1

* Stricter dependency: `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear < 1.3.0`.

## 0.11.0

* Introduce `Operation.call_with_public_interface_from_call` which merges `ctx` and `circuit_options`
  accordingly, so the overrider of `Operation.call_with_public_interface` gets correct args.
* Removing `Operation.trace`, you've been warned! Use `Operation.wtf?`. This also removes `Result#wtf`.
  See [https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-operation/blob/3f821c7d576e7ccccf580fbd8c9305501fdc5d2c/test/trace_test.rb#L22](this sample test case)
  if you need a more low-level interface to tracing.
* No need to pass `:exec_context` in `#call_with_public_interface`. This is  done in `Strategy.call`.
* Rename `Result#event` to `Result#terminus` for consistency. Deprecate `Result#event`.

## 0.10.1

* Deprecate `Operation.trace` and `Result#wtf?` in favor of `Operation.wtf?`.
* Use `trailblazer-developer-0.1.0`.

## 0.10.0

* Require `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear-1.2.0`.
* Remove `Railway::Macaroni`.
* Remove `Operation::Callable`.
* Introduce `Operation::INITIAL_WRAP_STATIC` that is computed once at compile-time, not
  with every `#call`.

## 0.9.0

* Use `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` 1.1.0.
* Pass `:container_activity` to `TaskWrap.invoke` instead of the superseded `:static_wrap` option.

## 0.8.0

* Use `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` 1.0.0.

## 0.7.5

* Upgrade `trailblazer-activity` & `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` patch versions.

## 0.7.4

* Fix `Operation.call` being called twice before delegating to `call_with_circuit_interface`. This is done via a special `call_task` in the operation's taskWrap.

## 0.7.3

* Revert trailblazer-developer to a runtime dependency.

## 0.7.2

* Bugfix: when calling `Operation.call(params: {}, "current_user" => user)` the stringified variables got lost in Ruby < 3.

## 0.7.1

* In `Operation.call_with_public_interface`, pass `self` and not `@activity` to the `invoke`r. This fixes tracing as it now catches the actual Operation class, not an activity instance.

## 0.7.0

* Compatible with Ruby 2.4-3.0.
* Add `Operation.wtf?`.
* Add `Operation.call_with_flow_options` to allow using explicit aliasing in Ruby < 3.0.

## 0.6.6

* Rename `Operation.flow_options` to `Operation.flow_options_for_public_call`.
* Operations can also accept `flow_options` at run-time now :beers:, giving them precedence over `Operation.flow_options_for_public_call`.

## 0.6.5

* Upgrade `trailblazer-activity` & `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` versions to utilise new `trailblazer-context` :drum:

## 0.6.4

* Remove container support. Containers should be part of `ctx` itself

## 0.6.3

* Require forwardable module from standard lib.

## 0.6.2

* Fix Trace so it works with Ruby <= 2.4

## 0.6.1

* Reintroduce `ClassDependencies` by leveraging `State.fields`.

## 0.6.0

* Require newest `activity` gem.

## 0.5.3

* New `context` API.

## 0.5.2

* Use `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear-0.1.6.`

## 0.5.1

* Remove Inspect. this now sits in the `developer` gem as `Developer.railway`.

## 0.5.0

* Minimal API around `Activity::FastTrack` to support the old public call style.


## 0.4.1

* Use `activity-0.7.1`.

## 0.4.0

* Use `activity-0.7.0`.

## 0.3.1

* Moved `VariableMapping` to the `activity` gem.

## 0.3.0

* Use `activity` 0.6.0.
* Remove `Operation::__call__` in favor of one `call` that dispatches to either
    * `call_with_public_interface` this implements the complicated public `Operation.()` semantic and will be faded out with the rise of workflow engines.
    * `call_with_circuit_interface` is the circuit-compatible version that will be invoked on nested operations.

    This might seem a bit "magical" but simplifies the interface a lot. In better languages, you could use method overloading for that, in Ruby, we have to
    do that ourselves. This decision was made with the deprecation of `Operation.()` in mind. In the future, operations will mostly be invoked from
    workflow engines and not directly, where the engine takes care of applying the correct interface.

## 0.2.5

* Minor fixes for activity 0.5.2.

## 0.2.4

*  Use `Activity::FastTrack` signals.

## 0.2.2

* Use `activity-0.4.2`.

## 0.2.1

* Use `activity-0.4.1`.

## 0.2.0

* Cleanly separate `Activity` and `Operation` responsibilities. An operation is nothing more but a class around an activity, hosting instance methods and implementing inheritance.

## 0.1.4

* `TaskWrap.arguments_for_call` now returns the correct `circuit_options` where the `:runner` etc.'s already merged.

## 0.1.3

* New taskWrap API for `activity` 0.3.2.

## 0.1.2

* Add @mensfeld's "Macaroni" step style for a keyword-only signature for steps.

## 0.1.0

inspect: failure is << and success is >>

call vs __call__: it's now designed to be run in a composition where the skills stuff is done only once, and the reslt object is not necessary

    FastTrack optional
    Wrapped optional

* Add `pass` and `fail` as four-character aliases for `success` and `failure`.
* Remove `Uber::Callable` requirement and treat all non-`:symbol` steps as callable objects.
* Remove non-kw options for steps. All steps receive keyword args now:

    ```ruby
    def model(options)
    ```

    now must have a minimal signature as follows.

    ```ruby
    def model(options, **)
    ```
* Remove `Operation#[]` and `Operation#[]=`. Please only change state in `options`.
* API change for `step Macro()`: the macro's return value is now called with the low-level "Task API" signature `(direction, options, flow_options)`. You need to return `[direction, options, flow_options]`. There's a soft-deprecation warning.
* Remove support for Ruby 1.9.3 for now. This can be re-introduced on demand.
* Remove `pipetree` in favor of [`trailblazer-circuit`](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-circuit). This allows rich workflows and state machines in an operation.
* Remove `uber` dependency.

## 0.0.13

* Rename `Operation::New` to `:Instantiate` to avoid name clashes with `New` operations in applications.
* Fix Ruby > 2.3.3's `Forwardable` issue.

## 0.0.12

* Allow passing tmp options into `KW::Option` that will be merged with `options` and then transformed into kw args, but only locally for the step scope (or wherever you do `Option.()`). The API:

    ```ruby
    Option::KW.(proc).(input, options, some: "more", ...)
    ```
  Note that `KW::Option` could be massively sped up with simple optimizations.

## 0.0.11

* Use `Forwardable` instead of `Uber::Delegates`.

## 0.0.10

* `Flow` is now `Railway`.
* Any `Right` subclass will now be interpreted as success.
* Add `fail!`, `fail_fast!`, `pass!`, and `pass_fast!`.
* The only semi-public method to modify the pipe is `Railway#add`
* Removed `&`, `>`, `<` and `%` "operators" in favor of `#add`.
* Extremely simplified the macro API. Macros now return a callable step with the interface `->(input, options)` and their pipe options, e.g. `[ step, name: "my.macro"]`.

## 0.0.9

Removing `Operation::consider`, which is now `step`.
We now have three methods, only.

* `step` import macro or add step with the & operator, meaning its result is always evaluated and
decides about left or right.
* `success` always adds to right track.
* `failure` always adds to left track.

This was heavily inspired by a discussion with @dnd, so, thanks! 🍻

## 0.0.8

* Introduce a new keyword signature for steps:

    ```ruby
    step ->(options, params:, **) { options["x"] = params[:id] }
    ```

    The same API works for instance methods and `Callable`s.

    Note that the implementation of `Option` and `Skills#to_hash` are improveable, but work just fine for now.


## 0.0.7

* Simplify inheritance by basically removing it.

## 0.0.6

* Improvements with the pipe DSL.

## 0.0.5

* `_insert` provides better API now.

## 0.0.4

* Don't pass the operation into `Result`, but the `Skill` options hash, only.

## 0.0.3

* Add `#inspect(slices)`.

## 0.0.2

* Works.
